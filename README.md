# work-day-planner

## Description
This work day scheduler allows you to add daily tasts to your todo list based on the hour. The interactive planner uses colors to signify whether each time block is in the past, present or future. When you add items to the todo list they are saved to local storage so they will still be there every time you come back to the page.
